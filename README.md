A refresh long-needed.

This uses `pandoc` to convert Markdown files into HTML. A bash script has been
cobbled together to recursively find the `.md` files and convert them to
HTML. It also uses a custom `pandoc` template for the HTML output.

So far this is pretty basic. It works for the purposes I have at the time.

It may demonstrate that Web Shit Doesn't Have To Be That Hard to some.

Tools and work this is based on:

1. [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
2. [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), included statically.
3. [PetMe](https://www.kreativekorp.com/software/fonts/c64.shtml), which is a very nice CBM/C64/C128 font implementation.
4. Color palette based on [work](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Color) at [The C64 Wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com).
